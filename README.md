[简体中文](./README_zh.md)

📊 `trivy-plugin-report` is a plugin that can convert Trivy's output in JSON format into an EXCEL file.

## 🤔 Why is it needed?

Trivy can output reports in various formats, but these reports are more suitable for technical personnel 
to study and fix vulnerabilities.

In many business scenarios, we also need to present security risks in a more understandable way 
to non-technical personnel, making EXCEL files particularly important.


## 🌟 Features

- **Trivy Compatibility**: Supports JSON format reports generated by Trivy.
- **Office Friendly**: Converts to EXCEL format, suitable for non-technical personnel to read and report.

## 🛠️ Installation

```shell
trivy plugin install github.com/y4ney/trivy-plugin-report
```

## 🚀 Usage

```shell
trivy image --format json -d --output plugin=report [--output-plugin-arg plugin_flags] <image_name>
```

OR

```shell
trivy image -f json <image_name> | trivy report [plugin_flags]
```

## 📝  Common Usage

1. Generate an EXCEL table and name it `output.xlsx`
    ```bash
    trivy image -f json debian:12 | trivy report --excel-file output.xlsx
    ```

2. Use `--beautify` to beautify the EXCEL file, that is, fill in the background color according to 
the severity of the vulnerabilities.
   ```bash
   trivy image -f json debian:12 | trivy report --excel-file output-beautify.xlsx --beautify
   ```
